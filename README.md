# python-api-challenge

#### This is a two-part assigment for the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. The first part consisted of gathering over 500 cities either by random or manually. Then, an API request needed to be made for each city through OpenWeather's API. As each API was requested, different statistics of the city's current weather were added to a list and those lists were converted into a dataframe. That dataframe was then used to make several figures comparing the different statistics within the dataframe to see if any strong correlations existed. Part two consisted of primarily using the gmap module within Jupyter Notebook. Each city from the part one dataframe was added to a heat map that intensified by humidity. A second dataframe was then made by running each city through specific "ideal" weather conditions, ending up with 10 cities. Then, each city was to be requested through Google's API to find the nearest hotel to each city's coordinates. A marker layer with the 10 cities' information along with its nearest hotel was added to the gmap figure. All of the figures were saved into the figures folder with the exception of the gmap which was saved as a screenshot.
